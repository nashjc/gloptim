NEWS for gloptim package

Changes in version 2024.05-01
            *  use fn1 to allow dot-args in glopt()
            *  remove section on match.fun() as it does not seem necessary
            *  had to de-archive gaoptim, hydroPSO  smco
            *  removed argument g from glopt() and gloptim(). Previously had
               "\item{g}{An additional function that specifies the feasible region,
               x is feasible if \code{g(x) >= 0} -- not used at the moment.}"
            *  removed argument rand from glopt() but NOT from gloptim(), where
               it defaults to FALSE. That is, we can "randomize" around a starting
               set of parameters in gloptim(), but glopt() always uses lower and
               upper bounds.
            *  In gloptim(), removed "minimize". This may be relevant for "ga" 
	       method, in that we now ONLY minimize with this package. (We may
	       wish to revisit this later.) 

Changes in version 2017.01-30  
            *  minor fixes to satisfy R CMD check

Changes in version 2017.01-30

            *  Method names can now be included and excluded.

Changes in version 2017.01-28
            *  Added 15 more stochastic/global solvers.
            *  Added 12 test functions and suggests globalOptTests.

Changes in version 2017.01-24
            *  Added DEoptimR::JDEoptim adagio::simpleDE.
            *  Changed the Hald test to a test for all solvers.

Changes in version 2017.01-23
            *  Added smco and soma.

Changes in version 2017.01-21
            *  Set up package using code from HWB gloptim.html document. 
            *  Usage in .Rd file had <- function() which HWB removed.
